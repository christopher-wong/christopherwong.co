          <h2>Product Security Dashboard</h2>
          <p>
            Developed a responsive web dashboard that aggregated security
            vulnerability data across Autodeskâ€™s broad portfolio of products.
            Surfaced valuable metrics that allowed product teams to track their
            compliance with security non-negotiables. Implemented a fully
            automated Continuous Integration and Deployment pipeline to
            facilitate best secure software development practices.
          </p>
          <h2>Automatic Savings Calculations</h2>
          <p>
            Led the development of an energy analytics platform that enables
            dynamic energy savings calculations and advanced data visualization
            using Python and Flask. </br> Automated data input processes
            allowing Energy Engineers to quickly and consistently provide
            in-depth analysis comments. This tool decreased processing time by
            up to 10% per building.
          </p>
          <h2>Gradr: Academic Grade Calculator</h2>
          <p>
            Worked with <a target="_blank" id="red-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinlittman">Justin Littman</a> to develop and deploy a fully-responsive and dynamic grade calculator using Python Flask and MongoDB. The web application allowed
            users to track grades in a variety of categories including homework, exams, and quizzes. It additionally supported Google and Facebook OAuth for user sign-up and authentication. As a demo and for testing purposes the application and database
            were hosted on DigitalOcean. <a target="_blank" id="red-link" href="../resources/gradr-pitch-deck.pdf">View our pitch deck </a>which was presented to a group of Northeastern students and faculty.

          <h2>Midi Music Editor</h2>
          <p>
            I developed a Java application that allowed for the playback, editing, and visualization of songs via the MIDI and Swing libraries.

          <h2>Bottlenose Submission Helper</h2>
          <p>
            Northeastern developed a custom homework grading server called Bottlenose which required students to manually zip the correct project directory, excluding hidden files, in order for the server to properly process submissions. I wrote a shell script that
            automatically created the proper zip before opening a web browser pointed to the correct submission page. This tool was used by a large majority of the students enrolled in the course. It's accompanied by a <a id="red-link" target="_blank"

            download page </a>which is statically hosted on Surge.sh.
